# Database Setup Script

## Objective

You will modify the provided SQL script so that it creates the tables and relationships for **your own project database**, not the sample question-library database.

This ensures:

* Your database design matches your project idea
* Your tables and keys are correctly defined
* Your database can be created from scratch using a single script

---

## Location of the Script

In the root of your project, there is a folder named:

```
sqlScripts
```

Inside that folder is a sample SQL script that:

* Creates tables
* Defines primary keys
* Defines foreign keys
* Sets up the sample question-library database

You will modify this script to reflect **your own database design**.

---

## Your Task

### 1️⃣ Update the SQL Script

Edit the existing script so that it:

* Creates **your project’s tables**
* Includes correct **primary keys**
* Includes correct **foreign keys**
* Uses appropriate data types
* Matches your approved database design

You should:

* Remove the sample question-library tables
* Replace them with your own schema
* Make sure the script runs without errors

If I run your script on an empty database, it should correctly create your entire schema.

---

### 2️⃣ Test It

Before committing:

* Delete your database (if necessary)
* Run the script from scratch
* Confirm all tables and relationships are created properly

If it doesn’t run cleanly, fix it.

---

### 3️⃣ Commit and Push

Once complete:

1. Stage your changes
2. Commit with a clear message such as:

```
Updated SQL script to match my project database design
```

3. Push to GitHub

---

### 4️⃣ Submit the Commit Link

Submit:

* A **direct link to the specific commit** (not just the repository)

To get the commit link:

* Go to your repository on GitHub
* Click “Commits”
* Click your most recent commit
* Copy the URL from the browser
* Submit that link

---

## Grading (Simple & Objective)

You will receive full credit if:

* ✅ Script creates your correct tables
* ✅ Primary keys are properly defined
* ✅ Foreign keys are properly defined
* ✅ Script runs without errors
* ✅ Commit was pushed
* ✅ Correct commit link submitted
