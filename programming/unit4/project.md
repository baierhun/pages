# 🔴 Unit 4 Project

## Modular Program with Functions & Exceptions

### Skills You Must Demonstrate

* Writing functions
* Parameters
* Return values
* Calling functions
* `try` / `except`

---

## Project Description

Create a new program OR improve a previous project from Units 1–3.

This time, your program must be organized using functions and include error handling.

---

## Requirements

Your program must:

* Include at least **3 functions**
* Include at least **1 function that returns a value**
* Include at least **1 function that takes a parameter**
* Include at least **1 `try` / `except` block**
* Handle invalid numeric input without crashing
* Be organized and readable

# 💡 Important Notes for All Units

* Your program must be school-appropriate.
* Creativity matters.
* Clear formatting matters.
* Variable names should be meaningful.
* Code should be organized and readable.
* You may build on previous projects as long as you meet the new unit requirements.

# 🎯 Goal of These Projects

Each project builds on the previous one:

Unit 1 → Basic interaction
Unit 2 → Decision making
Unit 3 → Repetition
Unit 4 → Organization and reliability

By the end of the course, you will be able to design and build a complete, structured Python program from scratch.

If you'd like, I can also create:

* Rubrics for each unit
* A single semester-long project option
* A reflection sheet students complete after each unit
* A pacing calendar with due dates and checkpoints
