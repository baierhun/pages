# Unit 1 Exercises

## Introduction

CodeHS Practice Activities are to be completed for each lesson within the unit. Although practice exercises are due at the end of the unit, it is best to complete each skill as you learn it because we build upon each previous skill in the next class period. Doing the activities daily will allow you to bring questions to class so we can review and clear up confusion.
