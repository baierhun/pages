Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is a trimester course in which students will discover what artificial intelligence (AI) is, how it is currently used, and how it could be used in the future. They will be introduced to machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks and how they already make decisions in daily life. Students will be taught the history of AI, how it is used today, and delve into the future of AI and its many possible applications while exploring issues and concerns surrounding AI. Students will experiment with numerous AI applications, and do some basic programming of an artificially intelligent system.

### **Graded Assignments**

All work must be submitted by the time specified on the assignment. Work submitted after this time will be considered late. Late assignments will not be eligible for full credit. Please see the student handbook regarding how late/missing assignments are graded.

From the student handbook: 

>“Academic Accountability Policy

>In order to maintain the equity and integrity of The Hun School’s academic program, the School maintains and enforces a school-wide Academic Accountability Policy on late work. Students are assessed a 5% per day credit penalty on all late work up to 10 calendar days at which time zero credit is assigned to the late or missing assignment. Students are permitted an additional 5 days after a zero has been assigned to work with the respective teacher to complete the work for up to 50% credit of the original assignment score. Students who have been granted excused absences are given one day per excused absence to make-up missing assignments before the Academic Accountability Policy is applied. “

Grades will be rounded to one decimal place. Final marking period grades are rounded to the nearest whole number from the average.

### **Cheating** 

Plagiarism, copying answers, logging in as someone else to complete assignments, and **any** other method where a student has not completed his/her own work honestly and independently \- will result in a **zero** and a referral to the Dean of Students.

Plagiarism in coding means presenting someone else’s work as your own. This includes copying all or part of a program from a classmate, online source, AI tool, or prior student. You must not look at, type for, or use each other’s computers to work on any work being handed in. All work should be entirely your own, and you must be able to explain every line of your code in detail. Using AI-generated code, copying explanations or analysis, or submitting old work (yours or others) from previous assignments or courses is also considered plagiarism. Violating these rules may result in academic disciplinary action.

### **Participation** 

You begin the term with full participation credit, and points are deducted only when expectations are not met. Deductions may occur for attendance issues such as unexcused absences, tardiness, or frequently missing class; lack of cooperation with classmates, including unwillingness to contribute productively to group activities; inappropriate use of technology, such as using devices for non-class purposes; and general classroom conduct that disrupts learning or does not meet established behavioral expectations. The goal of this system is to reward consistent positive engagement by maintaining full credit, while clearly identifying areas where points may be lost.

### **Technical Issues** 

Technical issues are not an automatic excuse for late work. If the platform we use is not working for you, you must email me as soon as possible to let me know what is happening. However, the assignment should still be considered due on the original deadline, and you are responsible for continuing to work on the problem and seeking a solution. Only if the platform officially announces system-wide downtime will assignment deadlines be extended.

If your personal device or home internet connection is not working, you are expected to make alternative arrangements (such as using school resources, a public library, or another available device) to complete your work on time.

### **Absences** 

When you are absent, it is your responsibility to determine what you missed and complete all required work. You should obtain class notes from a peer, check RaiderNet for updates, and/or meet with me to review missed material.

You will have the same number of days you were absent to make up any work assigned during your absence
*(Example: 2 days absent = 2-day extension).*

If you have questions about missed material or assignments, please attend Extra Help.

Please note: An absence before the day an assessment or assignment is due does **not** automatically extend the due date. You are still responsible for completing assessments on the scheduled date and submitting assignments on time unless you have made prior arrangements with me before or during your absence.

Assessments given during an absence must be made up within 5 school days of returning to school. It is the your responsibility to contact me to schedule a make-up time.

Please refer to the student handbook for the school wide late policy for points deductions and limitations on late work.

Early Dismissals are not absences. Submit all due assignments prior to our scheduled class time to receive full credit.

### **Extensions**

Requests for extensions or accommodations must be made with me at least one week in advance of any assignments or assessments.
