## Examples / Topics for Debate

---

### **Affirmative (Supports “Machines Can Be Intelligent”)**

1. **Agentic AI** – Machines that act autonomously and make decisions.
2. **Self-Driving Cars** – Navigate and respond to complex real-world situations.
3. **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants** – Can answer questions, hold conversations, and provide guidance.
4. **DeepMind AlphaGo** – Beat top human players at a complex strategy game.
5. **AI Creativity** – Machines composing music, art, or stories.
6. **Autonomous Drones / Robots** – Can complete tasks without human input.
7. **Recommendation Systems** – AI predicts user preferences and adapts over time.
8. **Plant & Animal Intelligence** – Demonstrates that intelligence doesn’t require human-like brains, supporting broader definitions that include AI.

### **Negative (Supports “Machines Cannot Be Truly Intelligent”)**

1. **Lack of Consciousness / Understanding** – Machines simulate thought but don’t truly understand.
2. **Chinese Room Argument** – A machine can process symbols without understanding their meaning.
3. **Ethical & Moral Judgment** – AI cannot reliably make value-based decisions.
4. **Emotional Intelligence** – Machines cannot feel empathy or emotions.
5. **Overfitting / Context Limits** – AI fails outside its trained scenarios.
6. **Dependence on Humans** – Requires humans to design, correct, and provide data.
7. **AI Bias & Errors** – Machines reflect human biases and make mistakes.
8. **Narrow AI vs. General Intelligence** – Most AI is specialized and cannot generalize like humans.

### **Neutral / Context (Can Be Used by Either Side)**

1. **Moltbook** – AI social platform where agents interact; can be cited to show simulated social intelligence or to argue it’s just mimicry.
2. **Turing Test** – Measures whether AI can imitate human intelligence; used to debate what counts as “intelligent.”
3. **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** – Describes how AI learns; can be used to show adaptability or limits of “understanding.”
4. **Computer Vision** – AI interpreting images; shows capability or argues for narrow intelligence.
5. **Human-AI Collaboration** – Can illustrate AI augmenting intelligence or that machines are tools, not independent thinkers.
6. **AI in Gaming** – Utility AI, NPC behavior; could be clever strategy or argue “preprogrammed” behavior isn’t real intelligence.
