## *Radiolab: Smarty Plants*

### Guided Listening Questions

**Directions:** There are 10 questions below. As you listen to [the podcast](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QK4wdMFvjfyybtgFgORX-lbSWSi36liN/view?usp=sharing), answer each question in order. Your answers should be meaningful and correct based on what you hear. This will be graded as complete/incomplete so be sure to answer every question meaningfully to avoid an incomplete grade.

The times for each part are listed below:
1. 2:43-13:05  
2. 16:53-26:18  
3. 26:18-36:30

### **Part 1: The Plant and Pipe Mystery**

1. Who are Alvin and Larry Ubell, and what surprising thing do they notice about tree roots and water pipes?

2. What hypothesis does Monica Gagliano test in her first experiment with plant roots in a Y‑shaped pot?

3. In the first experiment, how do the plants behave in the Y‑shaped pot when exposed to a real water pipe (outside the soil)?

4. What did Gagliano test next using **sound** instead of real water, and how did the plant roots respond?

### **Part 2: Mimosa Learning Experiment**

5. What is special about the *mimosa pudica* plant introduced in the second part of the episode?

6. In Gagliano’s second experiment, what happens to mimosa plants when they are dropped repeatedly? How does their response change?

7. How did the researchers show that the change in the mimosa’s behavior was *not* just fatigue or inability to respond?

### **Part 3: Plant Memory and Learning Over Time**

8. How long did the mimosa plants *remember* the experience of being dropped, according to Gagliano’s experiment?

9. What comparison does the episode make between this plant memory and animal learning?

10. Based on the experiments you heard about, what question does the episode raise about how we *think* about plant behavior and intelligence?
